<h1>Coolers</h1>

<h2>About the Project:</h2>
<p text align ="justify"> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ifeomaifechukwu/">Grace Ifeoma </a>and I collaborated on developing a website called Coolers. While Grace provided the design, I was responsible for developing and making a live version of the website. It was an exciting and rewarding experience as this was my first collaboration with a UI/UX designer. We aimed to ensure that the website adhered to the design specifications while providing an efficient and user-friendly platform. Although the website is not yet responsive, it offers an excellent experience for visitors to interact with its elements. Working with Grace taught me a lot about design expertise, and together we were able to create a website that met the design specifications and provided an excellent user experience.
